# Lab 5: QPSK Modulation and Demodulation

## Due NLT 31 Oct (Lesson 30) by 2359 on Gradescope

## Overview

So far we've looked at AM and FM signals and completed some basic GNU Radio Companion tutorials to help us better understand filtering and sample rates. In this lab we will shift to a digital modulation technique called Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). We will again use one of the tutorials from the GNU Radio Wiki page. This tutorial walks you through most of the communication chain from source to sink, with a special emphasis on signal distortion and channel impairments. You have been learning about ISI and timing errors in the past few lessons. In this lab you will implement a system that incorporates those errors _and_ ways to address them. You will also use eye diagrams to subjectively evaluate the system's effectiveness.

## Aims of the Lab

The goals of this lab are to:
    
- Understand why signal distortion (e.g., inter-symbol interference, or ISI) occurs and how to counter it.
- Understand channel effects on a signal and how to accurately recover the signal at the receiver.
- Provide experience using eye diagrams.
