# Homework 3

Chapter 5

## Due NLT 1 Oct (Lesson 20) by 2359 on Gradescope

## Directions: 
- Collaboration is authorized as noted in the syllabus Collaboration policy. 
- All homework must be complete, error-free, and _neatly organized_. **Points may be deducted for sloppy and illegible work.** 
- Answers should be clearly indicated by a box.
- Use engineering notation with proper units.
- Submit work to Gradescope with pages assigned to each problem. Scans/uploads must be legible and neat without excessive margins.

## Problems:
- 5.1-2 --> Nyquist rate is $f_s$, and the Nyquist interval is $T_s=1/f_s$.
- 5.1-5d --> Only part d (unless you want more practice by working out the other parts!). Use the equation in the text between Equations 5.14 and 5.15a.
- 5.1-8 --> The point of this problem is to show mathematically how an anti-aliaising helps reduce the error in a reconstructed signal. In Part (b) you find the energy of the error signal. Use the provided hint to set up the equation below. Use your plot from Part (a) to determine the piecewise formula for $\tilde{G}(f)$. In Parts (c-d) you will first sketch the spectrum after including an ideal anti-aliaising filter, and then you will repeat Part (b) to show the reduction in the energy of the error signal.  
$$E = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}||g(t)-\tilde{g}(t)||^2dt=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}||G(f)-\tilde{G}(f)||^2df$$
