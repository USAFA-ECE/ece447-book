# Lab 4: GNU Radio

## Due NLT 17 Oct (Lesson 25) by 2359 on Gradescope

## Aims of the Lab

The goals of this lab are to learn GNU Radio better and apply it to changing the sample rate of a signal.

## GNU Radio Tutorials

The GNU Radio wiki page contains several helpful tutorials for learning how to use GNU Radio. In this lab you will complete several of the foundational tutorials and then demonstrate what happens in the frequency domain when changing the sample rate of a signal.

Go to https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials. Complete the following tutorials:

- Introducing GNU Radio: Your First Flowgraph
- All tutorials under Flowgraph Fundamentals
- DSP Blocks: Low Pass Filter Example
- DSP Blocks: Sample Rate Change (skip the Decimation section)

After completing the Sample Rate Change tutorial, create a figure similar to the figure immediately before the Decimation section but for a signal interpolated up to 512 kHz instead of 128 kHz.

## Lab Report

Save your figure as a PDF, include a doc statement, and upload to Gradescope. Also, answer the questions in Gradescope.
