# Homework 2

Chapter 4

## Due NLT 15 Sep (Lesson 14) by 2359 on Gradescope

## Directions: 
- Collaboration is authorized as noted in the syllabus Collaboration policy. 
- All homework must be complete, error-free, and _neatly organized_. **Points may be deducted for sloppy and illegible work.** 
- Answers should be clearly indicated by a box.
- Use engineering notation with proper units.
- Submit work to Gradescope with pages assigned to each problem. Scans/uploads must be legible and neat without excessive margins.

## Problems:
- 4.2-8 --> Ignore the typo ']' after $m_2(t)$. Just sketch the plot by hand, ensuring your plot is neat and legible. Remember what the Fourier transforms of sinc and sinc $^2$ are.
- 4.3-6 --> Very similar to problem we went over in class!
- 4.5-1 --> FM: sketch by hand, but be sure to indicate what the minimum and maximum instantaneous frequencies are ($(f_i)_{min}$ and $(f_i)_{max}$). PM: sketch by hand; HINT: write out the equation for $f_i$ for PM with $\dot{m}(t)$ determined from the plot; indicate the minimum and maximum instantaneous frequencies ($(f_i)_{min}$ and $(f_i)_{max}$)
- 4.5-4
- 4.6-1
- 4.6-4
- 4.6-6 --> For Part (b), $m(t)=2sin(2000\pi t)$. For Part (c), $m(t)=sin(4000\pi t)$.
