# Homework 5

Chapter 6 (6.2-6.3)

## Due NLT 23 Oct (Lesson 27) by 2359 on Gradescope

## Directions: 
- Collaboration is authorized as noted in the syllabus Collaboration policy. 
- All homework must be complete, error-free, and _neatly organized_. **Points may be deducted for sloppy and illegible work.** 
- Answers should be clearly indicated by a box.
- Use engineering notation with proper units.
- Submit work to Gradescope with pages assigned to each problem. Scans/uploads must be legible and neat without excessive margins.

## Problems:
- **6.2-2** --> For Part (a)'s plot, use a _NRZ_ polar code. For Part (b), use the equations given in the textbook for each signaling type (6.13 - polar, 6.19b - on-off signaling, 6.21b - bipolar signaling). The textbook uses a _rectangular pulse_ when comparing the spectra of the three types. This problem uses a _triangular pulse_, so make the necessary adjustments in your equations in Part (b) and plots in Part (c).
- **6.3-1** --> Use Nyquist's first criterion for zero ISI. Remember that $u(t)$ is the step function. It is being used in this problem to 'turn the signal on or off.'
- **6.3-5** --> Eq. (6.33)
- **6.3-7** --> Given the data rate in Mbps (megabits per second), find the pulse rate $R_b$ in MHz by dividing out the number of bits per symbol. From there, you should be able to find your minimum required bandwidth, subtract that from the available bandwidth ($f_2$) to get the excess bandwidth $f_x (=f_1)$, and then use Eq. (6.31) to solve for $r$.
